**About Dataset**

"A triathlon is a multi-sport event consisting of three continuous endurance events. These events usually include swimming, cycling, and running, and are completed in immediate succession over various distances.

There are four recognized triathlon distances, with the most common being the "sprint" distance which usually consists of a 750-meter swim, a 20-kilometer bike ride, and a 5-kilometer run. Other distances include the Olympic distance (1.5 km swim, 40 km bike, 10 km run), the half-Ironman distance (1.9 km swim, 90 km bike, 21.1 km run), and the full Ironman distance (3.8 km swim, 180 km bike, 42.2 km run).

Triathlons require a high degree of physical fitness, endurance and mental toughness. Races can take place in various settings, such as open water, closed circuits, or on city streets. The sport has grown in popularity in recent years, with participation by both amateurs and elite athletes all around the world."
